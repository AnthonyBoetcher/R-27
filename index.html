              <p><b>Matimba Julian Nkuna 06/08/22 (Computer Science)</b><br>Matimba's research study aimed at investigating the use of Twitter feeds to train a Language Model to measure public sentiment towards governance in South Africa. Before participating my understanding of the role 
                was that we would be facilitating the process of machine learning in some way.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>I suspect our role is more of a human like reflection of tweet sentiment, which will be used to compare the accuracy of an existing machine learning program. 
                    Furthermore, I would think that despite developing a machine learning program capable of categorising 'tweet sentiment', I am sure there are instances were 
                a program could collect data, recognise patterns, but incorrectly categorise or misinterpret the tweet, especially as the data pool increases in size.<br><br>This is a reflection of complexities of human language, something machine languages strive to eliminate. There are no ambiguities in a world generated by 0's and 1's, and the challenge humans are faced with is trying to give machines the tools they need to 
                interact with our language, and us with theirs. This is no easy feat, and as far as I understand the difficulty is that a machine may learn but still needs our help to understand, with accuracy across large data sets, what we are trying to say with our words.<br><br> It may seem obvious, but since machines obviously lack the insight into human behaviour, they are confined to the tools given by it's creator and 
                learning through examples and searching for parameters.<br><br>The challenge becomes aparent when machines encounter parameters that express a different human sentiment to what the machine has learnt to predict. How must the machine interpret this new sentiment? It has all the signs of a 'disgruntled' tweet based on the tools it has at hand, and so the machine decides the tweet is displaying a negative sentiment. 
                However, a human observing this collection of words may interpret it as disgruntled but more specifically lighthearted and humorous. This is the 'human' part of language, which only gets more complicated the closer we get to direct human to human interactions. Then we have to start considering things like tone of voice, body language, eye movement, and I'm sure machine learning in this context would be vastly more complicated. 
                More on this once I assist in the study! <br><br>
                  As suspected, we were asked to assist in the machine learning. More specifically, we were faced with real tweets pulled from twitter, in a variety of languages. The users were shown language specific tweets based on their preferences, and were asked to ascertain a) If the tweet was Positive, Negative or Neutral, and b) Select the topic of the tweet based on several social categories mainly centered around pressing social concerns taking place in SA today.<br><br>
                  One issue I noticed was the limitation of language in describing the sometimes intangible 'feeling' of a tweet, and found that limiting the humans choices, to assist with machine learning, was also limiting our capacity to accurately reflect on a tweet. Within the confines, I suspect users may resort to selecting a sentiment that is not entirely applicable, particularly when facing ambiguous attitudes. <br><br>
                  Having encountered a handful of these 'on the line' tweets that indicate multiple diffirent sentiments, the reason for having the option to 'skip' the tweet became more apparent. This, along with the occasional unselected language sneaking in, meant that there was a large rate of 'skipped' tweets. So the question must be asked, if facing data that the human cannot or does not want to process to facilitate machine learning, and they skip that tweet, what kind of effect does this have on the accuracy for the machines understanding?<br><br>
                  Sure, there are many human participants collectively entering in data, but we cannot ignore the fact that many will skip tweets they rather not make a clear decision on, whereas others may be more inclined to select without giving it too much thought. Is this a comprehensive overview of that tweets 'sentiment'?<br><br>
                  Informal language use, as well as slang usage, makes interpreting tweets rather difficult. This, along with occasional cases where we have messages in a language other than their mother tongue. These cases are quite common, rather difficult to interpret and I found myself resorting to keyword evaluation rather than trying to understand the entire message as a whole. Worse yet are the scenarios where someone uses 2 or more languages! <br><br>
Another challenge are cases where a tweet is a response to another tweet. In these cases the human interpreter is given the link to the original tweet to gain some context. This link and context is vital. I quickly picked up that interpreting a response to a tweet can appear negative or show certain traits, only for you to realise it is lighthearted. There are even cases where the use of a 'negative' word can be made in a positive context. To add to this, the interpretation portal does not display images. For instance, an example of 'another little terrorist wins' as a tweet may appear, on first glance, as negative and perhaps commenting on public safety. You can speculate it is in reference to a child. But none of this is certain, with no context or image you would be forced to say it is negative as is much more likely the case in South Africa and the tweeting trends faced as the interpretor. Context in this regard has proved more significant than I would have anticipated. In the above example, the 'little terrorist' was a child 'winning' some sort of parent-child battle in the family context. <br><br>
Luckily we have the context as human interpretors, but how will machine learning evaluate situations like these? We know that a little terrorist is a child. But how will a machine decide it is a child and not 'a short terrorist' ?   I imagine there are many more examples like this, something the researchers will have to navigate.<br><br>
Another overarching trend was the fact that we are human interpretors in South Africa. We know the situation in our country, and the majority of tweets encountered largely reflect what has been portrayed in the media (in case this is not clear enough, it is VERY NEGATIVE). In fact it is rather disturbing how much negative public expression and speech is occurring on social media. I personally don't see the appeal of social media at all : It seems to be a place where disgruntled citizens can vent, which then feeds into itself > citizens reply to other citizens, arguments ensue, and soon we have a sespool of anger and conflict. But I digress. <br><br>
One thing I'd like to add is that South Africans have become heavily biased. I began the study considering this would play a big role. And it didn't take long for me to discover my own bias in interpreting tweets. Firstly, I gravitated towards negative tweet sentiment. Secondly, I struggled to see positivity in tweets discussing things like corruption, safety and security, corruption etc despite the tweet making a positive statement about it. For example, a tweet about arrests made based on corruption investigations, is in fact a positive tweet. Right? However I think most human interpretation of this is negative. Why? <br><br>
I suspect the reason we see these cases as negative is because it has only confirmed what is occurring and continues to occur in South Africa. Despite the tweet referring to a positive outcome, we as citizens see it as negative. What we have is bad news, wrapped in good news. The good news is armed robbers were arrested, the bad news is we still have a horrific unemployment rate and abject poverty seems to be getting worse. Hence reminding us , by giving us good news about it, is perceived negatively. Talk about a recipe for depression!<br><br>
What I'm trying to outline is that language amongst humans is incredibly complicated. You gave me good news, I see it as bad news. You said 'extremist' in a good context of transforming the country, but maybe I view the word 'expremist' in a poor light. There are many many examples of this, multiplied across multiple languages, that makes this study so difficult in my opinion, but also tackling a very pressing field : The interfaces between man and robot, and how to give robots the same or similar capacity to have human introspection and insight, without the human bias. The issue is, if you need humans to help train robots, how will you ever remove the human bias from the robots machine learning?<br><br>
                  That being said, we are facing the limitatons of human language, as well as the limitations and variability of human interpretation of the language. The affect this has on the accuracy of the data must be profound, and I sympathise with anyone trying to draw conclusions further than average sentiment. And as previously alluded to, I would think average sentiment adequately machine learnt through given parameters by the creator. So the case for using human interpretors to assist the machine is not entirely compelling. In some cases I doubt whether human 
                  input would be any improvement on the machine learning, simply because we, as humans, have our own major limitations in language and interpretation.
